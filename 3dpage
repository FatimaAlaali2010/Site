    <h1>Climate Change</h1>

    <h2>What causes climate change?</h2>
   
    <p> climate change is caused by a change in the earth’s energy balance
— how much of the energy from the sun that enters the earth (and its atmosphere)
is released back into space. The earth is gaining energy as we reduce the amount of
solar energy that is reflected out to space — just like people gain weight if there is
an imbalance between calories in and calories out.
Since the Industrial Revolution started over 200 years ago, human activities have
added very large quantities of greenhouse gases (GHG) into Earth’s atmosphere.
These GHG act like a greenhouse (or a blanket or car windshield) to trap the sun’s
energy and heat, rather than letting it reflect back into space. When the
concentration of GHG is too high, too much heat is trapped, and the earth’s
temperature rises outside the range of natural variability. /p>
   
    <h2>What can we do as of now to "buy time":</h2>
   
   
    <ul>
        <li>Reduce the global rate of sea level rise by 20% by 2050/li>
        <li> Cut global warming in half, or 0.6° C, by 2050 and by 1.4° C by 2100</li>
        <li>Prevent 2.4 million premature deaths globally each year</li>
      <li>Improve health, especially for disadvantaged communities</li>

      <li> Reducing air pollution related hospitalizations</li>
      <li>Promotion of reduced meat consumption</li>
      <li>   Stricter emissions standards, especially for diesel vehicles</li>
      <li>   Cleaner household cook stoves in developing nations</li>
    </ul>
   
    <h3>Why Short-Lived Climate Pollutants Matter:/h3>
   
    <ol>
        <p>The greenhouse gases with a high global warming potential but a short lifetime in
the atmosphere are called “short-lived climate pollutants” (SLCP). Key SLCP
include methane, black carbon, and the fluorinated gases. Because of the
combination of a short half-life and high GWP, the climate change impacts of the
SLCP are front-loaded — more of the impacts occur sooner, while the full weight of
impacts from CO2 will be felt later>
